### If you're new to web development...
If you're new to web development, **congratulations** on starting your journey!

There are two main languages that you'll start off with: [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) and [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp).

The best way to learn imho is to make your own website from scratch. Try replicating a plain website on your own, such as [Google](https://google.com)!
Here are some important things to look up how to do:

**HTML**
* Make headers and paragraphs
* Embed links
* Add in images (don't forget [a11y](https://www.a11yproject.com/))
* Read over how you can make your [website more accessible](https://webaccess.berkeley.edu/resources/tips/web-accessibility)
* How to make a list (numbered + bullet points)
* Read over this general [guide](https://webaccess.berkeley.edu/resources/tips/web-accessibility)

**CSS**
* Change fonts
* Change color of different headers, paragraph, and links
* Change image size
